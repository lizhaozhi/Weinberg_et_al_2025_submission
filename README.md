**“BCG vaccination induces trained immunity and modulates Alzheimer’s biomarkers across peripheral and CNS compartments”**  


### Overview
--

Aging is marked by immune remodeling and chronic low-grade inflammation that compromise resilience and promote neurodegeneration, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) immunotherapy, a potent inducer of innate and adaptive trained immunity, has been associated with reduced AD risk in retrospective studies and improved pathology in preclinical models. However, its effects on central immune function in humans are unknown. In a one-year open-label study of older adults with and without AD pathology, BCG reprogrammed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) monocytes and T cells, inducing transcriptional and metabolic features of durable enhanced glucose transport and enhanced responsiveness to inflammatory stimulation. Despite this, neither CSF monocytes nor T cells demonstrated recall responses to BCG antigen, unlike matched peripheral cells, revealing compartment-specific imprinting. BCG also modulated convergent immune-metabolic pathways implicated in both trained immunity and AD and promoted amyloid-β42 redistribution from CSF to plasma exclusively in non-AD individuals. These findings demonstrate that BCG engages CNS immune networks in aging humans and suggest a potential role for BCG trained immunity in early neurodegenerative intervention.
